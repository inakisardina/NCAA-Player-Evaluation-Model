Pitcher,Comment
"Uber, Ty","Pitcher from Stanford University with a two-pitch mix. His fastball sits in the low 90s and has a cut-like shape, staying closer to zero on the horizontal break scale compared to most fastballs. He tends to locate it on the glove-side part of the plate. While his walk rate is slightly high, the fastball profile shows promise and could be effective with refinement.

His secondary pitch is a mid-80s gyro slider, which he used around 60% of the time. It doesn’t sweep much but was effective at inducing weak contact. Across 104 innings, he recorded 98 strikeouts and posted a 6.02 ERA. Both pitches have interesting traits that could be developed further."
"Piper, Logan","Left-handed pitcher from the University of California with a five-pitch mix. He pitched 38 innings and recorded 35 strikeouts. His primary pitch is a four-seam fastball that sits around 88 MPH and features more ride than average, making it effective up in the zone.

His changeup and curveball are both interesting, showing strong vertical movement and solid spin rates. Despite the lower velocity, he consistently limited hard contact."
"Sagouspe, Tanner","North-to-south right-handed pitcher from Cal Poly. He relies heavily on his curveball, which features significant break and solid velocity, averaging 79.5 MPH. While it didn’t generate a high number of whiffs, it was effective at producing weak contact and serves as his primary pitch.

His fastball averages 91.1 MPH with movement trending toward the zero horizontal axis, giving it a strong shape. He also flashes a changeup with a 30% whiff rate, though he used it just 8.4% of the time—suggesting untapped potential. Over 44 innings, he posted a 3.65 ERA with 52 strikeouts."
"Edmondson, Clay","Right-handed pitcher from UNC Asheville with a very low sidearm delivery (not submarine). He threw 81 innings, recording 87 strikeouts and a 2.20 ERA. His primary pitch is a sinker averaging 89.5 MPH, which shows strong downward movement and generates weak contact. He posted a 58.9% ground ball rate, highlighting its effectiveness.

He locates the ball well for a sidearmer, showing reliable command. His secondary pitch is a slider that grades out as average in appearance but has produced good results. His sinker-heavy profile makes him a strong candidate for a ground-ball-focused relief role."
"Troy, Adam","Right-handed pitcher from Pepperdine University. He pitched 23 innings, recording 27 strikeouts with a 6.17 ERA. His fastball averages 93.7 MPH and shows slightly above-average ride, making it a solid offering. His changeup also shows potential, featuring a low spin rate and slightly more break than average.

He’s effective at limiting hard contact, with a 44.3% ground ball rate, indicating an ability to generate weak contact despite the elevated ERA."
"Ewaldsen, Collin","Right-handed pitcher from Mercer University. He pitched 25 innings, recording 30 strikeouts with a 4.68 ERA. His primary pitch is a fastball averaging 93.6 MPH, which shows good ride and stays close to zero horizontal break, giving it a strong vertical profile. He relies on it heavily, throwing it 79.2% of the time.

His secondary pitch is a slider with notable horizontal movement."
"Yeager, Isaac","Right-handed pitcher from Washington University. He threw 47 innings, recording 57 strikeouts with a 3.78 ERA. His primary pitch is a slider, which he throws 56.7% of the time. He commands it well and consistently generates weak contact, allowing just an 11.1% hard-hit rate.

His secondary pitch is a sinker averaging 91.3 MPH, showing good arm-side run and velocity."
"Taylor, Mitchell","Right-handed pitcher from UNLV with a two-pitch mix. His primary pitch is a gyro-style slider, which he throws 71% of the time. It’s effective at generating weak contact, with an average exit velocity of 75 MPH.

His secondary pitch is a four-seam fastball with slightly above-average rise, though it tends to get hit hard when not well-located. Over 21 innings, he posted a 3.86 ERA with 27 strikeouts."
"Edwards, Grant","Right-handed pitcher from the University of New Orleans. He pitched 76 innings, recorded 92 strikeouts, and posted a 4.23 ERA. His primary pitch is a sinker, which he throws 60% of the time at an average velocity of 91.4 MPH. The pitch shows good arm-side run and consistently generates weak contact.

His secondary pitch is a curveball, used 15.8% of the time, though it grades out as fairly average. He also mixes in a changeup (9.9% usage) with good run, though it doesn’t feature a large velocity gap from the sinker."
"Kittredge, Ryan","Right-handed pitcher from California Baptist University with a three-pitch mix. He threw 76 innings, recording 54 strikeouts with a 4.62 ERA. His primary pitch is a sinker averaging 91.5 MPH, which he locates well. While it doesn’t generate many whiffs, it has good sink and consistently induces weak contact.

His slider is a gyro-type that he also commands effectively and keeps off the barrel, rarely getting hit hard. His changeup shows solid drop, generates some swings and misses, and similarly avoids hard contact."
