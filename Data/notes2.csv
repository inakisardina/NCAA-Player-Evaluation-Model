Pitcher,Comment
"Hartman, Lucas","Right-handed pitcher from Western Kentucky University with a four-pitch mix. His primary pitch is a gyro-style slider, which he throws 32% of the time. It has a 16.5% whiff rate, rarely gets hit hard (74.6 MPH average exit velocity), and serves as a reliable swing-and-miss offering.

His four-seam fastball is his secondary pitch, averaging 90.1 MPH with good ride. He also features a curveball and changeup, both showing solid vertical movement. The curveball sits on the harder end at 78.1 MPH, while the changeup features a low spin rate and generates an impressive 25% whiff rate. He shows solid command of both the fastball and changeup.

He has transferred between three programs over the past three years and currently has a 10.46 K/9."
"Webb, Maddox","Right-handed pitcher from The Citadel with a three-pitch mix. He posted a 4.04 ERA with a 9.86 K/9 over the season. His arsenal includes a fastball (54% usage), curveball (28.4%), and slider (17.6%).

His fastball averages 92.4 MPH and has a cutter-like profile, staying close to the zero horizontal break line with above-average ride. It’s effective at limiting damage, allowing an average exit velocity of just 80.9 MPH. His curveball and slider both show above-average movement, with more vertical drop and horizontal break than typical.

He also features strong spin rates across all pitches. The curveball is particularly effective, generating an 18.4% whiff rate. Overall, he combines solid stuff with the ability to miss bats and limit hard contact."
"Stokes, Cole","Right-handed pitcher from the University of Oregon with a two-pitch mix. His primary weapon is a slider that excels at generating soft contact, with a hard-hit rate of just 6.7%. It’s a highly effective pitch that plays well in his arsenal.

His sinker is also a strong offering, contributing to an impressive 17.26 K/9, though his 7.08 BB/9 highlights some command issues."
"Rhudy, Bo","Right-handed pitcher from Kennesaw State. He posted a 3.16 ERA over 37 innings, recording 44 strikeouts with an excellent 1.22 BB/9. His primary pitch is a four-seam fastball, which stays very close to the zero horizontal break line and shows some ride, making it effective at the top of the zone.

He also throws a cutter with a similar shape, and both pitches are well-commanded. Across two years at Kennesaw State, he has shown consistently strong command, rarely walking batters and attacking the zone effectively."
"Beard, Trey","Left-handed pitcher from Florida Atlantic University with a three-pitch mix. He had a standout season, posting a 3.14 ERA with 118 strikeouts in 86 innings, and holding opponents to a .259 wOBA.

His primary pitch is a fastball averaging 91.6 MPH, complemented by a curveball and changeup. He consistently generates low exit velocities across all three pitches, making him effective at limiting hard contact while missing bats."

"Dotson, Luke","Left-handed pitcher from Mississippi State. He threw 23.1 innings, posting a 34.7% strikeout rate and a 12.2% walk rate. He relied heavily on his fastball, throwing it 86% of the time. The pitch averages 92.3 MPH, stays close to the zero horizontal break line, and shows strong movement, making it effective up in the zone. It consistently avoids hard contact.

While he rarely used his slider, it shows a promising movement profile and could be developed further as a secondary option."
"Aoki, Caden","Right-handed pitcher from USC. He logged 97 innings with an 8.35 K/9 and a 3.99 ERA. His primary weapon is a changeup, which he throws with good command and a very low spin rate. The pitch consistently generates whiffs and plays well off his fastball, giving him an effective off-speed option."
