Pitcher,Comment
"Book, Colton","Left-handed pitcher from St. Joseph's. He posted a 35% strikeout rate, relying heavily on his fastball (66.7% usage). The fastball averages 87.8 MPH, generates a 50% whiff rate, and limits hard contact with an average exit velocity of 78.7 MPH. It also shows more vertical rise than typical for pitchers with a similar release height, making it an effective swing-and-miss pitch.

His changeup, thrown 9.6% of the time, moves differently than most, behaving more like a cutter with movement closer to the zero horizontal line, while still showing above-average vertical drop. "

His primary pitch is a sinker averaging 88.7 MPH, showing strong arm-side run and consistently generating ground balls. His changeup also features good arm-side run combined with solid drop, further enhancing his ability to induce ground balls."
"Bailey, Carson","Left-handed pitcher from Baylor University with a four-pitch mix. His primary pitch is a sinker, which, along with his four-seam fastball, shows strong sink and arm-side run. The sinker is highly effective at generating ground balls, with a 78.6% ground ball rate.
