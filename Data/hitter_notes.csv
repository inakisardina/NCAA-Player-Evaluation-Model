"Ellison, Oliver","RHP from Coastal Carolina. Limited action in 2025 (7.2 IP, 9.39 ERA, 8.22 K/9), but showed more consistency in 2024 with 38.1 IP, a 4.46 ERA, and 2.24 BB/9. Primary pitch is a 91.3 MPH four-seam fastball (54.7% usage), complemented by a low-spin changeup (30% usage) that generates a high whiff rate (56.2%). Shows potential with his offspeed and command profile."
